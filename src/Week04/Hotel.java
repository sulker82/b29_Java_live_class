    /*Hotel [scanner, conditional, operators]

    Create a program that will allow you to check into a hotel. When checking in some information will be gathered and used to determine the information about the room and price

    Go through the following flow:

    Welcome to the Java Hotel
    How many days will you stay
		-> read number of days from console
    How many people are in your party
		-> read number of people from console

    In addition declare these variables:
    price, room type

    Use the information gathered to assign a room to the guests and print the information

    Data:
    number of people: 1
    assigned to a single room
    price is: number of days staying * 100

    number of people: 2
    assigned to a double room
    price is: number of days staying * 125

    number of people: 3 or 4
    assigned to a large room
    price is: number of days staying * number of people * 50

    number of people: 5 or 6
    assigned to a suite
    price is: number of days staying * 1000

    any other number of people is invalid and should output:
    sorry $number_of_people is not a valid group size
