        4BMI [nested if, multibranch, relational, arithmetic]

	Create a program that will calculate your BMI. Declare and assign the values
	for a mass (in kilograms) and height (in meters)

	first check if the given values are valid
		- the kilograms needs to be more than 40 and less than 185

		- the height also needs to be more than 120 and less than 250

		-> if either of those is not met print: "Sorry we cannot calculate the
		BMI with these metrics"

	if the given values are valid then calculate and print the BMI using the following formula
		BMI = mass / height^2

	use these ranges for BMI for print the result
		Less than 18.5 — Underweight
		From 18.5 to 24.9 — Normal weight
		From 25 to 29.9 — Overweight
		More than or equal to 30 — Obese

	sample data to use:
		mass = 64
		height = 1.65
		-> Normal weight

		mass = 90
		height = 1.8
		-> Overweight

		mass = 50
		height = 1.7
		-> Underweight
