You are buying a new house and need to collect information about the
houses in a specific neighborhoods.

	Create a program that will declare and define the neighborhood
	name and based on the name return a report of the houses in that
	area. The report should include this information: the average house
	 price, rating of school districts near by(out of 5), if it is a gated
	  community or not, and if pets are allowed

	print the final report in this format:
		$the houses in the $neighborhood_name on average value at $average_price.
		 This neighborhood $is_gated_or_not and the rating of the school distracts
		 near by is $school_rating out of 5. For the pet owners you $are_or_not in
		 luck because pets are $allowed_or_not_allowed

		Note: for simple use you can print true or false in the gated and pets parts,
		 but for a challenge try to print the message with as many dynamic parts as possible

	Data to use:

		name - Hills
		average price - 89,000
		rating - 4.0
		gated - no
		allow pets - yes

		name - Oaks
		average price - 75,000
		rating - 3.5
		gated - no
		allow pets - yes

		name - Highland
		average price - 150,000
		rating - 4.5
		gated - yes
		allow pets - no

		name - Canyon
		average price - 201,000
		rating - 4.8
		gated - yes
		allow pets - yes
