   /* Url [Scanner, String methods, conditional]

    Create a program that will allow the user to enter a url. The program will verify if the given url is valid and if it is print the domain name

    A url is valid if it has "www." in the beginning and has either .com, .org, .edu. or .gov at the end

    If the url is valid print the domain name part: $url is a valid url for google

    ex: www.google.com
    www.google.com is a valid url for google

    If the url is not valid print the reason it is not valid:

    ex: amazon.com
    Sorry, amazon.com is not valid because it is missing these:
    www. in the beginning

    ex: youtube
    Sorry, youtube is not valid because it is missing these:
    www. in the beginning
            .com, .org, .edu, or .gov in the end
