        Create a program that will have a String in a fixed format
         showing the results of a search. Based on that given format
         find the total number of search results and print them.

    Note: make the program as dynamic as possible for different
    sizes(it could be a number of 10 which is only 2 number digits
    or 100000 which is 6 number digits)

    Fixed format of the String:
        Total results found: $results. Sort, Filter, Ratings

    ex:
        "Total results found:3012. Sort, Filter, Ratings"
        -> 3012

        "Total results found:25. Sort, Filter, Ratings"
        -> 25

    Q: what is the datatype of the number we are getting in the end?
        Follow up, we will learn how to get this as an integer number in the future

        int indexStart = str.indexOf(':') + 1; // we add plus 1 because the number starts from the next index
        int indexEnd = str.indexOf('.'); // the substring will exclude this index
        System.out.println(str.substring(indexStart, indexEnd));
        //System.out.println(str.substring(str.indexOf(':') + 1, str.indexOf('.')));

      // abcadefa -> indexOf(a) -> 0 because that is the first occurrence of the character 'a'
