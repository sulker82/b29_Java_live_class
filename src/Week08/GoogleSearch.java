   GoogleSearch [Wrapper class, String, testing/automation idea]
   Create a program that will define a String that is given in a fixed format based on how google search results are displayed.
   format: About 3,940,000,000 results (0.39 seconds)
   Scenario: check if your search results are under 100 Million
       if the results are under print: Good Search
       if the results are over print: Narrow your search, too many results
   AC: User should be able to search in google and get results back in under 0.85 seconds or less
   Test Case:
       Given user opens the browser and navigates to google.com
       Then searches for {data}
       Verify if the time is less than or equal to 0.85 seconds
           > check the number of seconds it took for the results to see if the functionality is working properly
